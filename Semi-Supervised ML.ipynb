    "## Semi-Supervised Machine Learning\n",
    "This is a machine learning algorithm which is a combination of supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms. It came to play to tackle the challenge of having a supervised machine learning that needs labelled data. In the event that there is a large dataset, it can be costly to label the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to cluster data using unsupervised learning and then use labelled data to label the rest of the unlabelled data.\n",
